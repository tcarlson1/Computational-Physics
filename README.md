# Computational-Physics
This repository contains all of the work that I did this semester on the various projects for each module.

Unit 0: Introduction To Python
  This project required us to use the basics we learned about numpy, scipy, and pandas to create a notebook about Fourier Series
  
Unit 1: Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
  This project models the phugoid motion of a glider based off of previous work by Lorena barba and utilizing the Runge-Kutta 4 
  integrations methods covered in this module.
  
Unit 2: Modeling Chaos
  This project my examination of the R&ouml;ssler chaos function in which I calculate the lyupanov exponents based on different 
  parameters and initial conditions that make up the system and attempt to build the resulting poincar√© section.
  
Unit 3-4: Molecular Dynamic Simulation
  This project was an attempt to re-create the bouncing ball model found in the ejss simulation by Daniel Schroder et al. using
  the Lennard-Jones potential.  This was by far the hardest task of the semester and currently remains unfinished.
  
Final project: Diatomic Gas Simulation
  This project is a continuation from project 3-4 in which I wanted to find a way to implement a method to bond two particles into 
  a diatomic molecule.  This also remains unfinished albeit for different reasons than 3-4 due to an error in computing the 
  accelerations of the particles.
